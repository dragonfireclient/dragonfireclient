Dragonfire client is an utility client for the Voxel engine Minetest The client was created by Elias Fleckenstein and is inspired by the Minecraft clients liquidbounce and impactclient. 

Dragonfire is a hack client that allows you to do things that normal games  minetest does not allow you to do, such as flying on survival servers.

Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\Minetest\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\Minetest`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user`  = `~/.minetest`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User OR ~/Library/Application Support/minetest`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- This file is created by closing Minetest for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

#### Download

You can install Git for easily keeping your copy up to date.
If you donâ€™t want Git, read below on how to get the source without Git.
This is an example for installing Git on Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install git

For Fedora users:

    sudo dnf install git

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dragonfireclient/dragonfireclient
    cd dragonfireclient

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the "Development Test" game is available) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game

Download IrrlichtMt to `lib/irrlichtmt`, it will be used to satisfy the IrrlichtMt dependency that way:

    git clone --branch 1.9.0mt7 --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht.git lib/irrlichtmt

Download source, without using Git:

    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    cd minetest-master

Download minetest_game, without using Git:

    cd games/
    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv minetest_game-master minetest_game
    cd ..

Download IrrlichtMt, without using Git:

    cd lib/
    wget https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv irrlicht-master irrlichtmt
    cd ..

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:

    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    make -j$(nproc)

Run it:

    ./bin/minetest

- Use `cmake . -LH` to see all CMake options and their current state.
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package),
  you will want to use `-DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE`.
- You can build a bare server by specifying `-DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE`.
- You can disable the client build by specifying `-DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE`.
- You can select between Release and Debug build by `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>`.
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger.
- If you build a bare server you don't need to compile IrrlichtMt, just the headers suffice.
  - In that case use `-DIRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR=/some/where/irrlichtmt/include`.

- Minetest will use the IrrlichtMt package that is found first, given by the following order:
  1. Specified `IRRLICHTMT_BUILD_DIR` CMake variable
  2. `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/irrlichtmt` (if existent)
  3. Installation of IrrlichtMt in the system-specific library paths
  4. For server builds with disabled `BUILD_CLIENT` variable, the headers from `IRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR` will be used.
  - NOTE: Changing the IrrlichtMt build directory (includes system installs) requires regenerating the CMake cache (`rm CMakeCache.txt`)

### Compiling on Windows using MSVC

### Requirements

- [Visual Studio 2015 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Compiling and installing the dependencies

It is highly recommended to use vcpkg as package manager.

After you successfully built vcpkg you can easily install the required libraries:
```powershell
vcpkg install zlib zstd curl[winssl] openal-soft libvorbis libogg libjpeg-turbo sqlite3 freetype luajit gmp jsoncpp opengl-registry --triplet x64-windows
```

- **Don't forget about IrrlichtMt.** The easiest way is to clone it to `lib/irrlichtmt` as described in the Linux section.
- `curl` is optional, but required to read the serverlist, `curl[winssl]` is required to use the content store.
- `openal-soft`, `libvorbis` and `libogg` are optional, but required to use sound.
- `luajit` is optional, it replaces the integrated Lua interpreter with a faster just-in-time interpreter.
- `gmp` and `jsoncpp` are optional, otherwise the bundled versions will be compiled

There are other optional libraries, but they are not tested if they can build and link correctly.

Use `--triplet` to specify the target triplet, e.g. `x64-windows` or `x86-windows`.

### Compile Minetest

#### a) Using the vcpkg toolchain and CMake GUI
1. Start up the CMake GUI
2. Select **Browse Source...** and select DIR/minetest
3. Select **Browse Build...** and select DIR/minetest-build
4. Select **Configure**
5. Choose the right visual Studio version and target platform. It has to match the version of the installed dependencies
6. Choose **Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling**
7. Click **Next**
8. Select the vcpkg toolchain file e.g. `D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
9. Click Finish
10. Wait until cmake have generated the cash file
11. If there are any errors, solve them and hit **Configure**
12. Click **Generate**
13. Click **Open Project**
14. Compile Minetest inside Visual studio.

#### b) Using the vcpkg toolchain and the commandline

Run the following script in PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake . -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_GETTEXT=OFF -DENABLE_CURSES=OFF
cmake --build . --config Release
```
Make sure that the right compiler is selected and the path to the vcpkg toolchain is correct.

### Windows Installer using WiX Toolset

Requirements:
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)

In the Visual Studio 2017 Installer select **Optional Features -> WiX Toolset**.

Build the binaries as described above, but make sure you unselect `RUN_IN_PLACE`.

Open the generated project file with Visual Studio. Right-click **Package** and choose **Generate**.
It may take some minutes to generate the installer.

### Compiling on MacOS

#### Requirements
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Install dependencies with homebrew:

```
brew install cmake freetype gettext gmp hiredis jpeg jsoncpp leveldb libogg libpng libvorbis luajit zstd
```

#### Download

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git
cd minetest
```

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the "Development Test" game is available) using Git:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game
```

Download Minetest's fork of Irrlicht:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht.git lib/irrlichtmt
```

#### Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14 \
    -DCMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK=LAST \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../build/macos/ \
    -DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE -DENABLE_GETTEXT=TRUE

make -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
make install
```

#### Run

```
open ./build/macos/minetest.app
```

Docker
------
We provide Minetest server Docker images using the GitLab mirror registry.

Images are built on each commit and available using the following tag scheme:

* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:latest` (latest build)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<branch/tag>` (current branch or current tag)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<commit-id>` (current commit id)

If you want to test it on a Docker server you can easily run:

	sudo docker run registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<docker tag>

If you want to use it in a production environment you should use volumes bound to the Docker host
to persist data and modify the configuration:

	sudo docker create -v /home/minetest/data/:/var/lib/minetest/ -v /home/minetest/conf/:/etc/minetest/ registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:master

Data will be written to `/home/minetest/data` on the host, and configuration will be read from `/home/minetest/conf/minetest.conf`.

**Note:** If you don't understand the previous commands please read the official Docker documentation before use.

You can also host your Minetest server inside a Kubernetes cluster. See our example implementation in [`misc/kubernetes.yml`](misc/kubernetes.yml).


Version scheme
--------------
We use `major.minor.patch` since 5.0.0-dev. Prior to that we used `0.major.minor`.

- Major is incremented when the release contains breaking changes, all other
numbers are set to 0.
- Minor is incremented when the release contains new non-breaking features,
patch is set to 0.
- Patch is incremented when the release only contains bugfixes and very
minor/trivial features considered necessary.

Since 5.0.0-dev and 0.4.17-dev, the dev notation refers to the next release,
i.e.: 5.0.0-dev is the development version leading to 5.0.0.
Prior to that we used `previous_version-dev`.
