## dragonfireclient
Dragonfireclient is an utility client for the Voxelengine minetest (http://minetest.net/). The client was created by Elias Fleckenstein and is inspired by the Minecraft clients Liquid Bounce and Impact. Discord: https://discord.gg/kab99uu for more information.

Dragonfire is a hack client that allows you to do things that normal (a.k.a. “vanilla”)games  minetest does not allow you to do, such as flying on survival servers. While the client is mostly geared for use on the Clamity Anarchy server, which runs MineClone 2, it will work on any minetest compatible server. This is the first in a series of tutorials that will cover all the features and functions of dragonfire.
